The author argues that this financial exclusion not only perpetuates poverty but also poses a significant threat to democratic principles by concentrating wealth and power in the hands of a few.

      "summary": "This work explores the metaphors and language used to describe illnesses, particularly focusing on how metaphors of disease, specifically those related to cancer and AIDS, shape public perception and the experiences of the ill. It argues that such metaphors, often rooted in military and moralistic language, contribute to stigmatization, blame, and a sense of shame, hindering effective understanding and treatment of these conditions. The book advocates for a more literal and compassionate approach to illness, free from the burden of metaphorical interpretation, to improve the well-being of those afflicted.",
